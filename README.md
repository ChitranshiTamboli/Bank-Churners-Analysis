# Bank-Churners-Analysis
This repository contains the SQL file for the Bank Churners Analysis Project, designed to explore key behavioral patterns among churned customers based on transactional and demographic data.

OBJECTIVE:- The main objective of this project is to analyze customer data and identify the patterns that lead to churn, so the bank can take preventive action by reaching out to such customers proactively. 
   To publish the findings based on data analysis.

- To derive meaningful insights from the data, various business-impacting factors were analyzed.
- In this case study, there are 21 factors mentioning the age, salary, vintage, occupation, credit card limit, etc. of 28,382 customers.

            
              
#IMPORTANT FACTORS INFLUENCING CHURN :-
Customer's Age --> Gender --> Occupation --> Number of Dependents --> Tenure with the Bank --> Net Worth Category --> Credit Utilization Behavior --> Last Transaction Activity

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1)The number of customers churning in the age range of 30–39 years is the highest, followed by those under 30 — showing younger customers are more likely to leave.

2)Churn rate is slightly higher among males (19.15%) compared to females (17.55%), although the total number of female customers is higher overall.

3)Self-employed individuals show the highest churn rate (19.84%), while company employees are more stable.

4)Customers with more dependents (e.g., 6) show significantly higher churn, but these groups are smaller in number.

5)Very high credit utilization (>1.0) correlates with the highest churn rate (19.93%), indicating potential financial stress.

6)Both very high and very low average monthly balances are linked to higher churn, showing instability on both ends of customer segments.

7)Customers with lower tenure (vintage <1800 days) have a higher churn rate (19.36%), suggesting that longer engagement builds loyalty.

8)Surprisingly, recently active customers had the highest churn (20.41%), possibly due to unresolved issues.

9)High Net Worth individuals are churning the most (19.22%), suggesting dissatisfaction in premium services.

10)Certain branches showed 100% churn, indicating possible localized service issues or demographic factors.
